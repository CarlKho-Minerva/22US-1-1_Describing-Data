I am expecting my question to be answered with a \"yes\". However, I decided to choose this dataset because it looks at an American group (where American means the group of youth who grew up in the USA) as opposed to other cultures I am familiar with such as Asians.

    "Develop your estimation: Think of a quantity related to your research question that you can estimate. The estimation does not need to answer the research question directly, but should be connected to it somehow. Ideally, the estimated quantity would be directly related to the main variable under study (y) and would provide some insights to complement your analysis, but this may be challenging for some of the variables. So, you are encouraged to get creative with selecting which quantity to estimate! The most important factor is that your estimation allows you to show a deep understanding of various estimation strategies. For example, for the research question above about coffee consumption of Minerva students, one could estimate the milligrams of caffeine consumed by an average student over the course of a semester, or the money spent on coffee over an average student’s four years at Minerva, or the number of non-reusable coffee cups used by the Minerva students in a particular cohort. Estimating the number of cups of coffee in one day would probably not be complex enough to show a deep understanding. Here are some guidelines to develop your estimation and show a strong understanding:"

    "(1) We suggest beginning with an authentic math-wiz experience in the city. Go to a cafe in a neighborhood of your choice to produce a Fermi estimate of your variable using the back of a napkin from the cafe. It should be a true “back-of-the-napkin” estimation, so avoid looking up quantities directly. If you’re unable to visit a cafe, simply grab a napkin from wherever you are to jot down your estimation. Scraps of paper or sticky notes would also work. Your initial napkin estimation will probably be very rough/messy/scribbly (that’s kind of the point!) but note that when you type up your estimation (see below), you will have to describe each step clearly, show your work, state any assumptions you’re making, and discuss whether your answer seems plausible. Here, upload a photo of your back-of-the-napkin estimate."

The conversation regarding the gym garnered attention from 24 Minervans. I can safely set this as the lower bound through analogy because there may be other Minervans who will be peer-pressured into getting into the gym or are not conversing due to their preference for working out alone. I would think the number of people who I described as 16, which would make out the upper bound through analogy as 24 + 16 = 40 Minervans.

    "(2) Write five functions to calculate the mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation of a variable. Your code should not rely on library functions or packages directly, meaning that you cannot simply call “np.mean(data)”, “stats.mean(data)”, or other similar functions. Instead, write your stats calculators “from scratch”! This approach, along with sufficient in-line comments to explain the code, will allow you to demonstrate a strong understanding of #descriptivestats. If you use any built-in or imported functions within one of the steps of the function, (to sum or sort the data, for example) you need to explain how it works. Do not blindly use library functions without reviewing the documentation! "

    "------------------ CARL'S ANSWER ------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, the frequency of the youths' physical activities does not affect their hours of sleep on school nights. I noticed this as soon as I printed the descriptive statistics for both the discrete sufficient and insufficient weekly exercise categories. Both data sets result in a mean and median of seven (even when rounded off), meaning the respective youth are typically (the data source uses this term) getting seven hours of sleep. The standard deviations are low and the same in both charts, which reinforces my answers by asserting that the values are not spread out away from the mean of seven hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about the shape of my histograms, which represent the frequency of the and helps identify the modes. In fact, the histogram enabled me to notice the two modes in the \"insufficient exercise\" histogram, resulting in my using the multimodal function from the statistics module. I would give a warning when viewing my histograms: do not fall prey to the bell-curve-like shape and describe it as normally distributed charts. Normal distributions are reserved for continuous variables, which my data is not."

    "The simulation works by randomly generating seven sample data whose values range from 0 - 1 strictly. In the seven times where it is simulated, if the random function results in LESS THAN 0.51 (or the value of the variable A where it is 51/100), then it is stored in the temporary variable `A_count`. Similarly, if it is greater than 0.51, it is stored in the temporary variable `notA_count`. After the seven trials, the number of A's and A^c's are counted and checked to see if the number of A's equates to 3 and A^c's to 4 respectively. If it is, then another variable designed to track the number of times it happened, `threeA_fourNOTA` will be increased by one. The variables `A_count` and `notA_count` are then reinitialized to hold the value zero.\n",

    "This entire process is repeated 10,000 times. The number 10,000 was chosen according to the law of large numbers, which would consequently output a probability close to the value of getting 3As and 4 A^c analytically, which was 26.764731610785002%. The simulation abides by the frequentist interpretation of probability, where the probability builds off the initial probability results from the same simulation to refine further the \"accuracy\" of the simulation in relation to the outcome of the analytical calculation, where an exact probability is discovered through the use of formulae refined by the mathematicians over the years. Furthermore, I had no prior data on the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, so applying a Bayesian approach is impossible."

    "The organization of the HCs was highly-influential in the assignment. Having us identify the type of variables we were dealing with impacted the approaches we took even before we started calculating. Specifically, figuring out how I was dealing with discrete data heightened my senses in detecting float variables, as using decimals, a property exclusive to continuous variables, could threaten my consistency and my score.\n",

    "This assignment highlighted the importance of proper variable naming and data cleanup. Making the pandas column the correct data type while removing irrelevant portions helped clarify the calculations needed to get to the research answer. This practice also helped me craft data visualizations with extra attention to detail, such as reducing the bin size by increasing the number of bins to reduce confusion, as my XAxis would approach the 0.5 intervals when my data were purely whole numbers. I believe more data visualizations could be used to refine my answer. This time, it would be inferential instead of descriptive."
